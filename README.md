Over the past couple weeks, I've been looking to shore up my experience and knowledge in an IT Support or helpdesk context in order to get better grasp on how I may actually operate in the position. There is only so much reading and "book-smarts" that one can build before the need for hands-on application and experience become crucial. I've seen this in my time spent studying with UMGC. In my opinion, this not only applies to mainly technical fields, but even the more intangible ones such as sociology or psychology. The practical application of learned knowledge enhances our fundamental understanding of the subject, but often provides even more valuable growth opportunities. For example, I know about Active Directory and the various Windows Administrative tools, but never really had a reason to delve deeper. Now ask me how to do specific tasks according to specific problems? There may be a bit of an issue there. That is why I found the virtual/simulated lab portions of me studies to be extremely rewarding. 

Previously I've used a professional license of VMware provided by various courses. However, I have moved to VirtualBox due to it being free, but still extremely capable. I already had a Windows 2022 Server and Windows 10 Pro VM created and ready to go. However, there were a few things I did to tune it for the purposes of learning more about a helpdesk role.

## üß™ IT Support Lab Series

This series of labs walks through hands-on, practical IT support scenarios built in a home lab environment using VirtualBox, Windows Server 2022, Windows 10 Pro, and various industry tools. Each lab focuses on skills relevant to entry-level help desk, sysadmin, and GRC-aligned roles.

5. [**Silent Software Deployment with PDQ**](https://github.com/DCodeDavonte/IT-Support-Lab-Series/blob/main/pdq-deployment.md)  
   Used PDQ Deploy and Inventory to silently push applications across machines and track software installations.

6. [**Printer Access & Permissions in AD**](https://github.com/DCodeDavonte/IT-Support-Lab-Series/blob/main/printer-access-control.md)  
   Managed network printer sharing through Active Directory with customized access control based on security groups.

7. [**Spiceworks Remote Support & AD Tools**](https://github.com/DCodeDavonte/IT-Support-Lab-Series/blob/main/spiceworks-ad-tools.md)
