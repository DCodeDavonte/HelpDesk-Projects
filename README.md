Over the past week, I\'ve been looking to shore up my experience and
knowledge in an IT Support or helpdesk context in order to get a better
grasp on how I may actually operate in the position. There is only so
much reading and \"book-smarts\" that one can build before the need for
hands-on application and experience becomes crucial. I\'ve seen this in
my time spent studying with UMBC. In my opinion, this not only applies
to mainly technical fields, but even the more intangible ones such as
sociology or psychology. The practical application of learned knowledge
enhances our fundamental understanding on the subject, but often
provides even more valuable growth opportunities. For example, I know
about Active Directory and the various Windows Administrative tools, but
never really had a reason to delve deeper. Now ask me how to do specific
tasks according to specific problems, there may be a bit of an issue
there. That is why I found the virtual/simulated lab portions of my
studies to be extremely rewarding.

Previously I\'ve used a professional license of Vmware provided by
various courses. However, have moved to VirtualBox due to it being free,
but still extremely capable. I already had a Windows 2022 Server and
Windows 10 Pro VM created and ready to go. However, there were a few
things I did to tune it for the purposes of learning more about a
helpdesk role.
