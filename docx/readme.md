Over the past week, I've been looking to shore up my experience and

knowledge in an IT Support or helpdesk context in order to get better

grasp on how I may actually operate in the position. There is only so

much reading and "book-smarts" that one can build before the need for

hands-on application and experience become crucial. I've seen this in

my time spent studying with UMBC. In my opinion, this not only applies

to mainly technical fields, but even the more intangible ones such as

sociology or psychology. The practical application of learned knowledge

enhances our fundamental understanding of the subject, but often

provides even more valuable growth opportunities. For example, I know

about Active Directory and the various Windows Administrative tools, but

never really had a reason to delve deeper. Now ask me how to do specific

tasks according to specific problems? There may be a bit of an issue

there. That is why I found the virtual/simulated lab portions of me

studies to be extremely rewarding.

Previously I've used a professional license of VMware provided by

various courses. However, I have moved to VirtualBox due to it being
free,

but still extremely capable. I already had a Windows 2022 Server and

Windows 10 Pro VM created and ready to go. However, there were a few

things I did to tune it for the purposes of learning more about a

helpdesk role.
